# School_District_Analysis

## Results

- Replacing the 9th grade scores would not have a large impact on the math and reading scores based on grades. Removing those scores could have an impact if the value for the 9th grade was a significant outlier.

- There was no change in the scores based on how much the school spent per student dataframe.

- There was no change in the scores based on school size dataframe.

- There was no change in the scores based on school type dataframe.

## Summary

Replacing the ninth grade scores had the biggest affect on the scores for Thomas High School.

The percentage of students who passed math, reading, and passing overall saw noticable increases.

There was a small change to the district summary dataframe as well. The changes were less than a percent which could be attributed to subtracting a small number of total students whose scores were not strong outliers.
