# School_District_Analysis

## Objective

Use a jupyter notebook to examine data from a school district. There were discrepancies within a particular group, so the challenge was to remove the data in question and review the results.

## Results

- In the district summary, replacing the 9th-grade scores had a minor impact on the results of the school district grades. Average math and reading scores and the percent of students passing saw less than one percent change.

- Replacing the 9th-grade scores had a more significant change in the school results for Thomas High School. The averages for Thomas High School did not change, but the percent of students passing saw a drastic change. Thomas High School went from 67%, 70%, and 65% passing math reading and overall respectively to 93%, 97%, and 91%.

- Replacing the 9th-grade scores for Thomas High School significantly increased the standing of Thomas High School among the other schools. Thomas High School had the second-highest overall passing percentage.

Replacing the 9th-grade scores would not significantly impact the math and reading scores based on grades. Removing those scores could have an impact if the value for the 9th grade was a significant outlier.

- There was no change in the scores based on how much the school spent per student data frame.

- There was no change in the scores based on the school size data frame.

- There was no change in the scores based on the school type data frame.

## Summary

Replacing the ninth-grade scores had the biggest effect on the scores for Thomas High School.

The percentage of students who passed math, reading, and passing overall saw noticeable increases.

There was a slight change to the district summary data frame as well. The changes were less than a percent which could be attributed to subtracting a small number of total students whose scores were not strong outliers.
